# STAT159-fall-2016 Assignment 2

This repository holds the second assignment for the fall 2016 Statistics 159 at UC Berkeley.

This assignment is about applying the computational toolkit (plus R) to reproduce a simple regression analysis. More specifically, the idea is to reproduce the analysis from Section 3.1 (page 59 to 71), of *Chapter 3. Linear Regression*, form the book "An introduction to Statistical Learning" (by James et at) at [http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).
